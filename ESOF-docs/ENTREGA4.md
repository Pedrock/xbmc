## *Kodi* - Testes de Software

### Introdução

### Grau de Testabilidade do Software

#### Controlabilidade

(The degree to which it is possible to control the state of the component under test (CUT) as required for testing.)

#### Observabilidade

(The degree to which it is possible to observe (intermediate and final) test results.)

#### Isolabilidade

(The degree to which the component under test (CUT) can be tested in isolation.)

#### Separação de Funcionalidades

(The degree to which the component under test has a single, well defined responsibility.)

#### Compreensibilidade

(The degree to which the component under test is documented or self-explaining.)

#### Heterogeneidade

(The degree to which the use of diverse technologies requires to use diverse test methods and tools in parallel.)

### Estatisticas de Teste

( Number of tests (# tests unitários; # tests de sistema, # tests de desempenho, ...)
     % coverage (given by tools like EclEmma)
     Code coverage: is it any good? (see http://avandeursen.com/2013/11/19/test-coverage-not-for-managers/) )

### Correção de um *Bug*

([Opcional] Take a bug report, create test cases to reproduce it, and fix it, eventually using automated software fault diagnosis techniques. (grade >18) )
